"Tifflin" Experimental Kernel (and eventually Operating System)
=====

This is an experiment in writing an OS Kernel in rust (http://rust-lang.org).

Not a lot of real API design work has been done, but it will be written to be architecture independent (the current verison is x86\_64/amd64).


I have a vauge idea of making this OS not POSIX-like, but instead working on either an object-based API, or have something completely different :)



## Build Dependencies
`nasm` `imagemagick`
